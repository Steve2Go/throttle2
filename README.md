#  Throttle 2

## Transmission download & File Managment for iOS & Mac

Tested on Debian Server, with Mac server supported.
Windows server should work fine using the built in openSSH. A manual install of ffmpeg https://ffmpeg.org may be required if you use the iOS version

### Featuring
- Tunnel RPC over SSH
- Add & Monitor downloads
- OPens .torrents and magnet links
- File Managment
- SFTP & Traditional (Usually Samba) File Managment
- File Thumnails
- Torrent Creation (\*nix platform ignostic, server side)
- Server Controls


## Mac
- Automaticly Mount your remote drives over SFTP using SSHFS and Fuse-t for full file managment in finder

## iOS
- Built in File Browser using SSH & SFTP
- Split Screen control when mirroring. Image & video controls remain on device.
- Server side thumbnails for media. (Uses ffmpeg)
- Video playback and Image slideshows (On external display)

## To Come
- Local Daemon (Mac, with easy remote connection from iOS)

## In 1.5 Release
A Huge update with greatly simplified & refactored code
- Removal of redundant settings that were still being referenced, causing unexpected behaviour.
- Better & more reliable mouning & ssh operations
- Improved speed options for Mac Version
- Code cleanup & reactoring
- Dependencies are now part of the config flow

Based on lessons learned from Mission, https://github.com/TheNightmanCodeth/mission with borrowed code and ideas.

Throttle uses FFMpeg on the server to generate video thumbnails. After experimenting with all sorts of local generation, I've found this to be best - it's really fast, and puts almost no load on the server or the connection in comparison to local options.
A small ffmpeg binary will downloaded to your server if you don't already have it installed.


## Installation

### Mac

Download Throttle & add to your Applications folder.

We use SSHFS in combination with Fuse-t to provide a virtual files system over ssh. When choosing to map folders with SFTP you'll be prompted for permission to set this up.
Traditional file mapping via samba or any other finder supported file system is also available.

Thumnails are generated by Finder on Mac. qlvideo is bundled to facilitate thumbnails for types not supported nativly. You can access options in settings.

### iOS
Use your sideloading method of choice - I've found https://sideloadly.io/ to work well.

If you use key authentication, we also create a local proxy to play videos. It creates an FTP server on your iOS device for the video player to connect to, then streams over sftp using key authenication.
If you use password authentication, VLC will connect directly instead of using sftp.

*Note for windows users - due to the vast difference between windows and \*nix systems, I've made the assumption that you're using the built in openSSH, but it's largely untested. If anyone wants to help me test this / expand windows supprt, let me know.

Enjoy!
