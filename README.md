#  Throttle 2

## Transmission download & File Managment for iOS & Mac

### Featuring
- Tunnel RPC over SSH
- Add downloads
- Monitor Downloads
- Do basic torrent operations
- File Managment
- Easy intuitive managment
- SFTP & Traditional (Usually Samba) File Managment
- File Thumnails
- Torrent Creation (Uses torrent-create, installed with transmission-cli from your servers package manager)

## Mac
- Mount your remote drives over SFTP using SSHFS and Fuse-t for full file managment in finder

## iOS
- Built in File Browser using SFTP
- Server side thumbnails for media (Requires FFMpeg on your server), falls back to client side using VlcKit
- Playback via VlcKit with a contuious play implimentation

## To Come
- Server Stats & Controls
- Local Daemon (mac)
- Better messaging on server actions (Success, fail etc)
- Streaming files via HTTP over SSH for ios versions (Better streaming capabilities)
- Keyfile support for ssh key file authentication (More feasible once file streaming is implimented due to use of VlcKit)
- Removal of MFT Framework (In favour of Citadel)

Based on lessons learned from Mission for Mac & Throttle 1 (a fork of mission)

## Server Preparation

### Reccomended setup for a mac server (In additions to transmission):
Install Homebrew and transmission-create if not already installed:  
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"'
`brew install transmission-cli'
For server side Thumnails for the ios version of throttle (Reccomnded)
`brew install ffmpeg`
Enable remote login (ssh): https://support.apple.com/lt-lt/guide/mac-help/mchlp1066/mac

### Reccomended setup for a Debian or Ubuntu server (Ina addition to transmission):
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install transmission-cli'
For server side Thumnails for the ios version of throttle (Reccomnded) on ubuntu
`apt install ffmpeg`

## Installation

### Mac
Download Throttle & add to your Applications folder.

We use SSHFS in combination with Fuse-t to provide a virtual files system over ssh. When choosing to map folders with SFTP you'll be prompted to install the bundled version, which is a direct download from website.
Traditional file mapping via samba or any other finder supported file system is also available.

Thumnails are generated by Finder on Mac. qlvideo is reccomended for better thumbnails on Mac, and also for thumbnails in finder (The ffmpeg implimentation in Throttle is rudimentary at best).

### iOS
Use your sideloading method of choice - I've found https://sideloadly.io/ to work well.

### Server Side Thumbnails on iOS
Throttle has client side thumbnailing, but it's not as good as I'd like (Inprovements to come). 
I'd reccomend installing FFmpeg on your server and enabling server side thumbnails in the Throttle server settings page.

Enjoy!
