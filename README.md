##Installation

###Mac
Download Throttle & add to your Applications folder
Thumnails are generated by Finder.

To use SFTP:
Download and install these 2 packages - they manage connecting to your sever with SSH
https://www.fuse-t.org/downloads
https://github.com/macos-fuse-t/sshfs/releases/tag/1.0.2

Traditional file mapping via samba is also available. 

To view thumbnails on files not traditionally supported by Finder, download Quicklook Video
https://github.com/Marginal/QLVideo/releases/tag/rel-221

Enjoy!

###iOS
Use your sideloading method of choice - I've found https://sideloadly.io/ to work well

###Server Side Thumbnails on iOS
Throttle has client side thumbnailing, but it's not as good as I'd like. The latest FFmpegKit has been retired for ios, and VLC as an alternative really slows things down. 
I'd reccomend installing FFmpeg on your server and enabling server side thumbnails in the Throttle server settings page.

On Debian, ubuntu etc:
```sudo apt install ffmpeg```
On Mac:
Install Homebrew using terminal:
```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Install FFmpeg:
brew install ffmpeg```
