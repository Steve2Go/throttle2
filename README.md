## Installation

### Mac

Download Throttle & add to your Applications folder.

We use SSHFS in combination with Fuse-t to provide a virtual files system over ssh. When choosing to map folders with SFTP you'll be prompted to install the bundled version, which is a direct download from github.
Traditional file mapping via samba or any other finder supported file system is also available.

Thumnails are generated by Finder on Mac. qlvideo is reccomended for better thumbnails on Mac, and also for thumbnails in finder (The ffmpeg implimentation in Throttle is rudimentary at best).

### iOS
Use your sideloading method of choice - I've found https://sideloadly.io/ to work well.

Throttle for iOS needs FFMpeg on the server to generate video thumbnails. 

An installer is included in the iOS app to help you install this. The Mac version does not have this requirement.
You can still use Throttle without ffmpeg, but video thumbnails will be generic play icons.

*Note for windows users - due to the vast difference between windows and \*nix systems, I've made the assumption that Windows Subsystem for Linux is installed. You can install it with `wsl --install` from powershell. If anyone wants to help me test this / expand windows supprt, let me know.

Enjoy!
